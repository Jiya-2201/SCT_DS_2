# Task 2 – Univariate Analysis on Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This task is part of my internship where I performed **Univariate Analysis** on the Titanic dataset.  
The goal of this task is to explore individual features (one variable at a time) using statistical methods and data visualizations to gain meaningful insights.

## 🔑 Steps Performed
### 1. Data Collection
- Downloaded Titanic dataset (`train.csv`, `test.csv`).
- Placed them inside the `data/` folder.

### 2. Data Loading
- Loaded the dataset using **Pandas** (`pd.read_csv`).

### 3. Data Inspection
- Checked shape, columns, and info of the dataset.
- Identified missing values and data types.

### 4. Univariate Analysis
- Analyzed **categorical features** (`Sex`, `Pclass`, `Embarked`, `Survived`).
- Analyzed **numerical features** (`Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, `Parch`).

### 5. Data Visualization
- Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for plots.
- Plots included:
  - Count Plots (for categorical variables).
  - Histograms & KDE plots (for numerical variables).
  - Pie charts (for proportions).
- Added **colorful & clear themes** for better readability.

### 6. Key Insights
- Majority of passengers were in **3rd class**.
- More **male passengers** than female.
- Females had a **higher survival rate** compared to males.
- Most passengers were **20–40 years old**.
- Fare distribution was **right-skewed** (few very high fares).
